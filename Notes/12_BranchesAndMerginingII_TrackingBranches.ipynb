    "## Tracking Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tracking Branch Overview\n",
    "    - A local branch that represents a remote branch (`<remove>/<branch>`)\n",
    "    - A remote branch that is clone to a the local machine will have everything that the remote branch contains (references and commits) with the addition of a reference to the remote master branch (the branch label that the remote referenced to before the clone)\n",
    "    - <img src=\"./images/git_35.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "    - Notice that there could be three master branch label could point to three different commits: the local master branch, the remote master branch, and the master tracking branch\n",
    "        - This occurs because there is no way that the remote and local repo can communicate with one another (unless they are clone, push, fetch, or pull)\n",
    "        - <img src=\"./images/git_36.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Viewing Tracking Branch Names\n",
    "    - `git branch --all`: Displays local and tracking branch names\n",
    "    - <img src=\"./images/git_37.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "    - In the image above, only the first and third line represent unique branches\n",
    "    - The second line references a symbolic link to an existing branch\n",
    "    - The second line actuall branch is the branch that is after the arrow (->)\n",
    "    - `remote/origin/master`: where origin is alias for the remote URL. It tracks the lates commit from the remote repo\n",
    "    - `master`: Points to the latest local repo\n",
    "    - `remote/origin/HEAD`: It appears that the only use of this is to refer to `origin/master` and thus, can be reference without stating `origin/master` but just `origin`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Changing `remotes/origin/HEAD`\n",
    "    - We can change the default remote tracking branch... `git remote set-head <remote> <branch>` where remote is \"origin\" and branch is \"develop\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Viewing Tracking Branch Status\n",
    "    - `git status` includes tracking branch status\n",
    "    - `git status` will inform you if the cached tracking branch information is out of synch with your local branch\n",
    "    - <img src=\"./images/git_38.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "    - Notice how the command line states that the local repo is ahead of the remote repo by 1 commit\n",
    "    - Use `git log --all` to see a combine log of all local and tracking branches\n",
    "    - <img src=\"./images/git_39.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "    - In the screenshot above, we can see that the local repo (`HEAD -> master`) is ahead of the remote repo (`origin/master`) by one commit (or one feature)\n",
