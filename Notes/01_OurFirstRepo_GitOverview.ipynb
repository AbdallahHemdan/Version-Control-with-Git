    "    - Content: Complete history tracked and available at any time\n",
    "    - Teams: It allows team to have an excellent workflow. It supports many workflows and colloboration. Lastly, it produces quality through team and communication and reviews.\n",
    "   - Agility: It manages small changes and it easily can make update and undo changes.\n",
    "   - Type of Content:\n",
    "       - It is commonly used for managing the source code related to software projects\n",

    "           - Users can work offline because every user has a local copy\n",
