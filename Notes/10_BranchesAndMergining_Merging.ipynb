    "1. Merging Overview\n",
    "    - Main Types of Merges: Fast-forward merge, merge commit, squash merge, rebase\n",
    "    - <img src=\"./images/git_23.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "    - In the screenshot above, commit M is the commit that contains the merge from featureX (its a bit weird the pointing direction of the arrows)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Fast-Forward Merges\n",
    "    - Moves the base branch label to the tip of the topic branch\n",
    "        - <img src=\"./images/git_24.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "    - This is an easy method where we move the reference to the lastest change from the new branch reference\n",
    "    - However, for a Fast-Forward Merge to be possible, no other commits could have been made to the base branch since branching\n",
    "    - For example, if the screenshot below, we notice that there have commits after commit B and thus, using a Fast-Forward Merge cannot be possible\n",
    "        - <img src=\"./images/git_25.png\" width=\"200\">\n",
    "    - Performing a Fast-Forward Merge\n",
    "        - `git checkout master`\n",
    "        - `git merge featureX #Attempting a fast forward merge is the default`\n",
    "        - `git branch -d featureX`\n",
    "        - <img src=\"./images/git_26.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "    - Why delete a Feature Branch Label?\n",
    "        - It prevents a continous increase in the number of merged branch labels\n",
    "        - Dealing with an ever increasing number of feature branch labels can be confusing\n",
    "    - Linear Commit History\n",
    "        - The resulting commit history is linear\n",
    "        - There are no commits that have multiple parents\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Merge Commits\n",
    "    - Combines the commits at the tips of the merged branches\n",
    "    - Places the result in the merge commit\n",
    "    - Keep in my mind that combining the work of multiple commits may result in what's called a merge conflict\n",
    "    - <img src=\"./images/git_27.png\" width=\"200\">\n",
    "    - In the screenshot above, notice how there were a few more commits that occured after the commits in the feature branch label and thus, we will include these new commits in the new commit M\n",
    "    - A no fast-forward merge means that a merge commit will always be created, even if the merge is fast-forwardable\n",
    "        - `git merge --no-ff featureX`\n",
    "    - Merging Long-Running Branches\n",
    "        - These merges are typically easy because they are fast-forwardable\n"
